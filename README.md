Starting point to get started working with a state machines that can be used to continuously process data or monitor
things in a stateful way

DEBUG - state_driver - The context is in State2
DEBUG - state_driver - Context: Transitioning to State1
DEBUG - state_driver - The context is in State1
INFO - state_driver - SIGNAL 2 or CTRL-C detected.
DEBUG - state_driver - Context: Transitioning to Terminate
